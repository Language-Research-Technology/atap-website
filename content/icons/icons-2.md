The collection includes literature intended for popular audiences as well as literature intended for audiences concerned with literary quality or the establishment of a national canon. The bibliographical information associated with these records enables researchers to investigate the relationships between texts and particular publishers or to track the first publication of each text in newspapers, magazines or journals. The collection includes bibliographic and production information for works of fiction and poetry, writing for the theatre, biographical and travel writing, writing for film and television, criticism and reviews and the people and organisations who produce them.
