### Webinars {#webinars}

Our webinar series is a joint initiative with the Language Technology and Data Analysis Laboratory ([LADAL](https://slcladal.github.io/index.html)), (School of Languages and Cultures, University of Queensland). LADAL sponsored [webinars](https://slcladal.github.io/webinars2022.html) take place in the alternate months.

All webinars take place at 8:00PM Brisbane time which is UTC+10. Zoom links will be available one week prior to the event.

#### October 3 2022 - Paweł Kamocki: European Union Data Protection initiatives and their consequences for research

**Abstract**:<br>
The European Union, with its large population and GDP, is a leading force in regulatory globalisation. This webinar will discuss recent developments in legal frameworks affecting research data in Europe. Apart from the General Data Protection Regulation which, since its entry into application in 2018, has become an international standard of personal data protection, the recent introduction of statutory copyright exceptions for Text and Data Mining will also be discussed. Moreover, the webinar will also include a presentation of the most recent changes in EU law, such as the Data Governance Act and the Artificial Intelligence Act, which are expected to enter into application in the coming years.

**Paweł Kamocki** is a legal expert in Leibniz-Institut für Deutsche Sprache, Mannheim. He studied linguistics and law, and in 2017 obtained his doctorate in law from the universities of Paris and Münster for a thesis on legal aspects of data-intensive university research, with a focus on Knowledge Commons. He worked as a research and teaching assistant at the Paris Descartes university (now: Université de Paris), then also in the private sector. He is certified to work as an attorney in France. An active member of the [CLARIN](https://www.clarin.eu/) community since 2012, he currently chairs the CLARIN Legal and Ethical Issues Committee. He also worked with other projects and initiatives in the field of research data policy (RDA, EUDAT) and co-created several LegalTech tools for researchers. One of his main research interests are legal issues in Machine Translation.

#### August 1 2022 - Václav Cvrček: The Czech national Corpus

[Václav Cvrček](https://ucnk.ff.cuni.cz/en/institute/people/vaclav-cvrcek-2/) is a linguist who deals with the description of the Czech language, especially with the use of large electronic corpora and quantitative methods. In 2013-2016 he worked as the director of the [Czech National Corpus](https://ucnk.ff.cuni.cz/en/) project, since 2016 he has been the deputy director. Recently, he has been focusing on research on textual variability and corpus-based discourse analysis with a focus on online media.

#### June 6 2022 - Barbara McGillivray: The _Journal of Open Humanities Data_

Barbara McGillivray is a Turing Research Fellow at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/), and Editor in Chief of the [Journal of Open Humanities Data](https://openhumanitiesdata.metajnl.com/). Since September 2021 she is also a lecturer in Digital Humanities and Cultural Computation at the [Department of Digital Humanities of King's College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/ddh). Before joining the Turing, she was language technologist in the Dictionary division of Oxford University Press and data scientist in the Open Research Group of Springer Nature. Her research at the Turing is on how words change meaning over time and how to model this change in computational ways. She works on machine-learning models for the change in meaning of words in historical times (Ancient Greek, Latin, eighteen-century English) and in contemporary texts (Twitter, web archives, emoji). Her interdisciplinary contribution covers Data Science, Natural Language Processing, Historical Linguistics and other humanistic fields, to push the boundaries of what academic disciplines separately have achieved so far on this topic.

#### 4 April 2022 - Keoni Mahelona: A practical approach to Indigenous data sovereignty

Keoni Mahelona is the Chief Technical Officer of [Te Hiku Media](https://tehiku.nz/) where he is a part of the team developing the Kaitiakitanga Licence. This licence seeks to balance the importance of publicly accessible data with the reality that indigenous peoples may not have access to the resources that enable them to benefit from public data. By simply opening access to data and knowledge, indigenous people could be further colonised and taken advantage of in a digital, modern world. Therefore Keoni is committed to devising data governance regimes which enable Indigenous people to reclaim and maintain sovereignty over indigenous data.

### Forthcoming workshops {#forthcoming-workshops}

#### Australian Text Analytics Platform tools: Discursis, Juxtorpus, Quotation tool and Semantic tagger

The [ARDC](https://www.ardc.edu.au) HASS Research Data Commons projects, ATAP and [LDaCA](https://www.ldaca.edu.au), aim to establish cloud-based, collaborative, data-driven research platforms with generalised workflows for text and language researchers across diverse research disciplines. The Sydney Informatics Hub (SIH) and Sydney Corpus Lab (SCL) are partners in these national projects and have developed a series of text analytic tools in the form of online Jupyter Notebooks.

During the afternoon session of the USyd Digital Humanities Day 2023 ([morning session](https://usyd.libcal.com/event/5526162)), the SIH will host a combined workshop to demonstrate and teach several recently or soon-to-be-released tools from the ATAP text analytic tool collection. These tools include Discursis for analysing human conversational texts, Juxtorpus for advanced corpus slicing and comparison, Semantic Tagger for semantically tagging every word in your text collections, and Quotation Tool for NLP algorithm-based quotation extraction, analysis, and visualisation. All tools will be hosted on the cloud and no coding experience or software installation is required. Participants just need to bring their devices for some hands-on practice in the web browser and can continue using these convenient tools for their own projects afterwards.

**When**: Tuesday 14 March 2023, 1:00PM - 4:00PM<br>
**Where**: University of Sydney, Fisher Interactive Learning Space (209)<br>
[Details and Registration](https://usyd.libcal.com/event/5527942)

#### Jefferson Transcript Search Tool

The Search Tool project uses programming to explore how to easily search and manipulate transcripts without the need to 'clean' the transcript. A browser-based tool has been developed, designed to be used by researchers unfamiliar with programming.

The workshop will include a presentation about the process of development, and an interactive technical demonstration where you will be able to use the tool with a transcript of your own. After using the tool, there will be a facilitated discussion about future work on the tool and implications for using the tool as part of analytic workflow, particularly for collections-building.

You won't need any technical knowledge to enjoy this workshop, but familiarity with basic computer usage will be helpful. It is intended for [Ethnomethodology / Conversation Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversation_analysis) practitioners familiar with [Jefferson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gail_Jefferson) transcripts, however anyone with an interest is welcome.

The workshop will be presented by Evelyn Ansell and is an outcome of her Career Development placement with Australia's Academic and Research Network ([AARNET](https://www.aarnet.edu.au/)). The Jupyter Notebook tool and this workshop have been developed during that placement.

**When**: Friday 17 March 2023, 1:30PM - 3:30PM (AEST)<br>
**Where**: University of Queensland, Chamberlain Building 35, Room 104<br>

### Office Hours {#office-hours}

We invite Australian researchers working with linguistics, text analytics, digital and computational methods, social media and web archives, and much more to attend our regular online office hours, jointly hosted with the [Digital Observatory](https://research.qut.edu.au/digitalobservatory/). Bring your technical questions, research problems and rough ideas and get advice and feedback from the combined expertise of our ARDC research infrastructure projects. No question is too small, and even if we don’t know the answer we are likely to be able to point you to someone who does.

These sessions run over Zoom from 2-3pm (Australia/Sydney time) every second Tuesday - [details](https://research.qut.edu.au/digitalobservatory/office-hours/).
