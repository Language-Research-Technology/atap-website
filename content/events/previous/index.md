#### Jefferson Transcript Search Tool

The Search Tool project uses programming to explore how to easily search and manipulate transcripts without the need to 'clean' the transcript. A browser-based tool has been developed, designed to be used by researchers unfamiliar with programming.

The workshop was presented by Evelyn Ansell and is an outcome of her Career Development placement with Australia's Academic and Research Network ([AARNET](https://www.aarnet.edu.au/)). The Jupyter Notebook tool and this workshop have been developed during that placement.

**Date**: Friday 17 March 2023

**Length**: 90 minutes

**Facilitator**: Evelyn Ansell

#### A hands-on guide to Semantic Tagger for your text data analysis

The Australian Text Analytics Platform (ATAP) project is a project that aims to provide researchers with the tools and training for analysing, processing, and exploring text. As part of this project, we have adapted with permission, a Semantic Tagger, developed by the University Centre for Computer Corpus Research on Language ([UCREL](https://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/)) at Lancaster University. This tool uses the Python Multilingual UCREL Semantic Analysis System ([PyMUSAS](https://pypi.org/project/pymusas/)) to tag your text data so that you can extract token level semantic tags from your text. In addition to the USAS tags, this tool can also recognize Multi Word Expressions (MWE), i.e., expressions formed by two or more words that behave like a unit such as 'South Australia', and identifies lemmas and Part-of-Speech (POS) tags in the text. For example, in the sentence ‘President Joe Biden attended two meetings today’, the tool will tag each token with its semantic tag like this -> ‘President Joe Biden’: MWE of [Personal names], ‘attended’: [Participating], ‘two’: [Number], ‘meetings’: [Participating] and ‘today’: [Time: Present; simultaneous]. This tool is available in both English and multi-lingual (Chinese, Italian and Spanish) versions and supports saving the results locally for further analysis, enabling you to gain meaningful insights into your research questions.

**Date**: Wednesday 22 March 2023

**Length**: 90 minutes

#### Australian Text Analytics Platform tools: Discursis, Juxtorpus, Quotation tool and Semantic tagger

This workshop was part of the USyd Digital Humanities Day 2023.

The workshop demonstrated and taught several recently or soon-to-be-released tools from the ATAP text analytic tool collection. These tools include Discursis for analysing human conversational texts, Juxtorpus for advanced corpus slicing and comparison, Semantic Tagger for semantically tagging every word in your text collections, and Quotation Tool for NLP algorithm-based quotation extraction, analysis, and visualisation.

**Date**: Tuesday 14 March 2023

**Length**: 3 hours

**Facilitators**: Staff of the Sydney Informatics Hub

#### HASS Research Data Commons and IRC Computational Skills Summer School

The Australian Research Data Commons ([ARDC](https://www.ardc.edu.au)) through the HASS Research Data Commons and Indigenous Research Capability (HASS RDC and IRC Program) offered a Computational Skills Summer School in Sydney, February 7 and 8, 2023.

The Summer School featured skills development workshops to help researchers use the research infrastructure that is being created in the HASS RDC and IRC Program.

The projects from the HASS RDC and IRC Program presented workshops on using the tools and platforms.

#### Pre-conference workshop (before the 2022 Conference of the Australian Linguistic Society)

The Australian Text Analytics Platform and the [Language Data Commons of Australia](https://www.ldaca.edu.au/) presented a day of workshop activities to give ALS conference delegates (and anyone else who is interested) the opportunity to learn more about the work of the two projects. The day included:

- an overview of the projects and the work to date
- reports on specific sub-projects
- introductory workshops on the tools and resources being developed
- a workshop on using Discursis, a tool for tracking topics in interactive use of language
- the opportunity to influence future work by exploring and providing feedback on the data interface which we are building.
